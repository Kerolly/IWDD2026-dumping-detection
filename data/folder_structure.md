### 📂 `data/`
**Purpose:** Contains all raw and processed data. This folder *should not* include large files in Git (see `.gitignore`).

- **`data/videos/`** — Contains the 500 raw video clips (`.mp4`).
- **`data/annotations/`** — Contains the 500 original `.json` files provided by the organizers (ground truth).
- **`data/splits/`** — Contains the file lists generated by `01_prepare_dataset.py`. These ensure that the entire team uses the same 80/20 train–validation split.
  - `train_split.json` — List of videos used for training.
  - `val_split.json` — List of videos used for validation.
- **`data/yolo_dataset/`** — *(Generated)* Contains the extracted frames and `.txt` annotation files (bounding boxes) used for YOLO training.
